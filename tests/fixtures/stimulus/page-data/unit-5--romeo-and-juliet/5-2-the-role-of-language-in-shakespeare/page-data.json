		"text": "5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n\n        Completion requirements\n        \n\n\n\nKey Literary Devices in Shakespeare\nShakespeare is the most influential writer in the English language.  A double-threat poet and dramatist (playwright), Shakespeare captured the imaginations of both the upper-class courtiers and the commoners in London.  In fact, Shakespeare\n    wrote a mix of poetry (verse) and prose (everyday speech) in Romeo & Juliet.  \nIn general, the upper-class characters, like the Montague, Capulets, and the Prince speak in blank verse, unrhymed iambic pentameter (10-syllable lines with a stressed, unstressed patter).  By contrast, most servants, comic characters,\n    and lower class characters speak prose, or common language.  Though their prose is different than today's, Shakespeare used many of these characters as comic relief, making some rather dirty jokes in the process!\n\n    In particular, Romeo, Juliet, and Friar Lawrence speak in thoughtful, poetic iambic pentameter to elevate them above the rest.  Benvolio, on the other hand, will deliver plain, unimaginative iambic pentameter.  The Prince\n    and Tybalt will really flex, speaking strong, war-like iambic pentameter.  Lord and Lady Montague speak short, choppy iambic tetrameter, while Mercutio, the Nurse, and servants will deliver dark, bawdy prose (common language).\n     Mercutio is a \"mercurial,\" person to sudden or unpredictable changes of mood or mind.  Mercutio is both comic relief and a tragic commentator on the action.  His famous \"Queen Mab\" monologue foreshadows the fateful night\n    to come.\n\n\nThere are three kinds of speeches in the play: monologues, soliloquies, and asides.  Monologues are long speeches delivered to others on stage to deliver public information.  Soliloquies are long speeches delivered\n    alone on stage in order to reveal a character's private thoughts or fears.  Asides are brief comments made under one's breath that the audience can hear, but others on stage do not hear or pretend not to hear.  \n\nAs you read Act II, look for more sonnets, one by the Chorus as a prologue to the action, and one by Romeo as he gives Juliet their first kiss at the party.  Pay close attention to both literal imagery (her \"hand\" and \"lips\") and\n    figurative imagery (\"holy shrine\").  Talk about one of the great pick-up lines in history!  Romeo has got game!  Act II also begins the thrust of the dramatic irony of the play in which only a few characters (Friar\n    Lawrence and the Nurse) and the audience know about the secret marriage.  Dramatic irony is achieved when the audience knows crucial information that others on stage do not.  We know that Romeo and Juliet are married,\n    but Mercutio, Tybalt, and their parents do not!  Can you imagine?\n    \n\nHere are some other old words no longer in use today:\n\n\n    \n        \n            Anon: shortly\n            Avaunt!:  go away! \n            Ere: before\n            Thou: you\n            Thy: Your\n            Aye or Ay: Yes\n            Doth: does, do\n            O’er: Over\n            ‘Tis: It is\n            Is’t:  Is it\n        \n    \n\n\nAssignment: Read Act II of Romeo & Juliet by William Shakespeare (original and modern text side by side)Watch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nLanguage in Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 5.1\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 5.2\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

			"content": "Completion requirements\nKey Literary Devices in Shakespeare\nShakespeare is the most influential writer in the English language.  A double-threat poet and dramatist (playwright), Shakespeare captured the imaginations of both the upper-class courtiers and the commoners in London.  In fact, Shakespeare\n    wrote a mix of poetry (verse) and prose (everyday speech) in Romeo & Juliet.  \nIn general, the upper-class characters, like the Montague, Capulets, and the Prince speak in blank verse, unrhymed iambic pentameter (10-syllable lines with a stressed, unstressed patter).  By contrast, most servants, comic characters,\n    and lower class characters speak prose, or common language.  Though their prose is different than today's, Shakespeare used many of these characters as comic relief, making some rather dirty jokes in the process!\n\n    In particular, Romeo, Juliet, and Friar Lawrence speak in thoughtful, poetic iambic pentameter to elevate them above the rest.  Benvolio, on the other hand, will deliver plain, unimaginative iambic pentameter.  The Prince\n    and Tybalt will really flex, speaking strong, war-like iambic pentameter.  Lord and Lady Montague speak short, choppy iambic tetrameter, while Mercutio, the Nurse, and servants will deliver dark, bawdy prose (common language).\n     Mercutio is a \"mercurial,\" person to sudden or unpredictable changes of mood or mind.  Mercutio is both comic relief and a tragic commentator on the action.  His famous \"Queen Mab\" monologue foreshadows the fateful night\n    to come.\n\n\nThere are three kinds of speeches in the play: monologues, soliloquies, and asides.  Monologues are long speeches delivered to others on stage to deliver public information.  Soliloquies are long speeches delivered\n    alone on stage in order to reveal a character's private thoughts or fears.  Asides are brief comments made under one's breath that the audience can hear, but others on stage do not hear or pretend not to hear.  \n\nAs you read Act II, look for more sonnets, one by the Chorus as a prologue to the action, and one by Romeo as he gives Juliet their first kiss at the party.  Pay close attention to both literal imagery (her \"hand\" and \"lips\") and\n    figurative imagery (\"holy shrine\").  Talk about one of the great pick-up lines in history!  Romeo has got game!  Act II also begins the thrust of the dramatic irony of the play in which only a few characters (Friar\n    Lawrence and the Nurse) and the audience know about the secret marriage.  Dramatic irony is achieved when the audience knows crucial information that others on stage do not.  We know that Romeo and Juliet are married,\n    but Mercutio, Tybalt, and their parents do not!  Can you imagine?\n    \n\nHere are some other old words no longer in use today:\n\n\n    \n        \n            Anon: shortly\n            Avaunt!:  go away! \n            Ere: before\n            Thou: you\n            Thy: Your\n            Aye or Ay: Yes\n            Doth: does, do\n            O’er: Over\n            ‘Tis: It is\n            Is’t:  Is it\n        \n    \n\n\nAssignment: Read Act II of Romeo & Juliet by William Shakespeare (original and modern text side by side)Watch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nLanguage in Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet\nPrevious activityQuiz 5.1\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 5.2\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
