		"text": "5.3 Figurative Language\n\n        Completion requirements\n        \n\n\n\nLiteral and the non-literal\nLiteral language is straightforward and concise, a kind of \"I mean what I say\" delivery, with a single interpretation.  Figurative language, by contrast, is \"extra,\" as there are multiple ways to interpret its meanings.  If\n    someone throws some shade your way, you may ask, \"What did you mean by that?\"  It's usually because there are double meanings in those words.\nFigurative language is all about double meanings and coded language.  If we make a comparison between two similar things, it is known as an analogy.  If we make a comparison between two unlike things, it is\n    known as a metaphor.    If we make a comparison between two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as\", it is known as a simile.  If we place any two things next to each other expressly for comparison or contrast,\n    it is known as juxtaposition.  If we connect two opposite things to each other, it is known as antithesis.  If we call a thing by both its name and its opposite name together, it is called an oxymoron.\n     If an event happens that is the exact opposite of what expected to happen, we call it situational irony.  If something bad happens that we knew about (as a reader or audience member) but could do nothing to prevent (in\n    terms of the outcome of a story or performance), we call it dramatic irony.  If we say something that is the opposite of what we mean, we call it\n    verbal irony.  If we say something that is the opposite of what we mean in a nasty way, we call it sarcasm.  If we exaggerate the meaning or importance of something, we call it hyperbole    (or overstatement).  If we downplay the meaning or importance of something, we call it understatement.\nShakespeare uses a mix of literal and figurative language in Romeo and Juliet.  Just at Juliet's lines in Act II:\nGo ask his name: if he be married.My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\n\n\n\nWhich line is literal and which is figurative?  What kind of figurative language is she using?  If you said that the first one is literal, you would be correct!  Juliet wants the Nurse to go ask Romeo's name and to see if he is married.\n     The second line uses a simile to compare her wedding bed to a grave, a kind of antithesis (opposites together).  Look for more of this tension of opposites as you read.\nAssignment: Read Act III of Romeo & Juliet by William Shakespeare (original and modern text side by side)\nWatch the following videos after you read the novel:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nFigurative Language in Romeo & Juliet\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 5.2\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 5.3\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

			"content": "Completion requirements\nLiteral and the non-literal\nLiteral language is straightforward and concise, a kind of \"I mean what I say\" delivery, with a single interpretation.  Figurative language, by contrast, is \"extra,\" as there are multiple ways to interpret its meanings.  If\n    someone throws some shade your way, you may ask, \"What did you mean by that?\"  It's usually because there are double meanings in those words.\nFigurative language is all about double meanings and coded language.  If we make a comparison between two similar things, it is known as an analogy.  If we make a comparison between two unlike things, it is\n    known as a metaphor.    If we make a comparison between two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as\", it is known as a simile.  If we place any two things next to each other expressly for comparison or contrast,\n    it is known as juxtaposition.  If we connect two opposite things to each other, it is known as antithesis.  If we call a thing by both its name and its opposite name together, it is called an oxymoron.\n     If an event happens that is the exact opposite of what expected to happen, we call it situational irony.  If something bad happens that we knew about (as a reader or audience member) but could do nothing to prevent (in\n    terms of the outcome of a story or performance), we call it dramatic irony.  If we say something that is the opposite of what we mean, we call it\n    verbal irony.  If we say something that is the opposite of what we mean in a nasty way, we call it sarcasm.  If we exaggerate the meaning or importance of something, we call it hyperbole    (or overstatement).  If we downplay the meaning or importance of something, we call it understatement.\nShakespeare uses a mix of literal and figurative language in Romeo and Juliet.  Just at Juliet's lines in Act II:\nGo ask his name: if he be married.My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\n\n\n\nWhich line is literal and which is figurative?  What kind of figurative language is she using?  If you said that the first one is literal, you would be correct!  Juliet wants the Nurse to go ask Romeo's name and to see if he is married.\n     The second line uses a simile to compare her wedding bed to a grave, a kind of antithesis (opposites together).  Look for more of this tension of opposites as you read.\nAssignment: Read Act III of Romeo & Juliet by William Shakespeare (original and modern text side by side)\nWatch the following videos after you read the novel:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nFigurative Language in Romeo & Juliet\nPrevious activityQuiz 5.2\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 5.3\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
