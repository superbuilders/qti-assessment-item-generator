rather, it is often more specific than the evidence itself.  It is a \"digging deeper\" process that continues to polish the evidence until it is a golden nugget, a worthy find.\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nSummarizing vs. Analyzing Evidence in Academic Writing\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 3.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 3.4\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

			"content": "Completion requirements\nAnalysis and Synthesis vs. Summary of Evidence\nImagine you're a criminal investigator or a lawyer in a high-profile trial.  Evidence is key.  The difference between a guilty or innocent verdict is how you explain the evidence to a jury and judge.  Do you tell stories?  Do you use\n    graphs?  Do you role play?  How do you break down the evidence so that it is meaningful and impactful to a general audience?  \nIf your claims are the bricks, if your reasoning is the mortar holding them in place, and if your evidence is the scaffolding supporting it all, then your analysis of evidence is the finished building, the \"after\" photo showing what it means to live in\n    the place when finished.\nAnalysis and commentary are the second half of academic writing.  After the claim and evidence (the first half), analysis and commentary of evidence are what connects all the information together.  It is the destination of where the writer has\n    guided the reader all along.  Evidence and commentary are where claims are proved true and valid.  It is where your evidence is grounded and supported.  It is where your conclusions are stated.  \nThe act of analyzing evidence is a process of breaking up the evidence into smaller pieces that can better be understood by the reader.  Analysis is \"surgery,\" pulling out selected key pieces of evidence to polish to a fine shine.  \nAnalysis is not summary.  It is not general; rather, it is often more specific than the evidence itself.  It is a \"digging deeper\" process that continues to polish the evidence until it is a golden nugget, a worthy find.\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nSummarizing vs. Analyzing Evidence in Academic Writing\nPrevious activityQuiz 3.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 3.4\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
