Evidence is the wooden structure that supports and is supported by all claims\n    (building blocks). A better analogy might be that of the sandwich: claims are the bread (starters); reasoning are the condiments (the special sauce); and evidence is the main ingredient, the meat or the cheese, in the middle.  \nThink of a paragraph as a sandwich. The C-E-C method illustrates this sandwich-making process:\nC-E-C Paragraph:Claim: topic sentence and reasoning (1-2 sentences)  Evidence: quotes or data used as support (1-2 sentences) Commentary: analyzes the evidence and connects it to the claim. (2-4 sentences)\n\n\n\nEvidence comes in all shapes and sizes. In English, teachers mainly require quotes from the text as evidence. In Social Studies, teachers may use artifacts (objects, maps, graphs). In science and math, data    is primarily used as evidence. A mix of all evidence may be presented in longer research projects.\nIn humanities, evidence is measured on how close it is to the original source. An original source is also known as a primary source. If someone paraphrases a primary source, it becomes a secondary source. If someone paraphrases a secondary source, it becomes a tertiary source. And so on...\nFor example: \n\n    \n        I conduct an experiment on water quality and publish my results: PRIMARY SOURCE\n        My friend writes about my results in the school newspaper: SECONDARY SOURCE\n        A national newspaper writes about my friend's article: TERTIARY SOURCE\n    \n\nA mix of all types of sources are needed in most research projects, depending on the topic, audience, and purpose.Watch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\nReading:Types of Evidence Used to Write a Paper\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 3.2\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 3.3\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

Evidence is the wooden structure that supports and is supported by all claims\n    (building blocks). A better analogy might be that of the sandwich: claims are the bread (starters); reasoning are the condiments (the special sauce); and evidence is the main ingredient, the meat or the cheese, in the middle.  \nThink of a paragraph as a sandwich. The C-E-C method illustrates this sandwich-making process:\nC-E-C Paragraph:Claim: topic sentence and reasoning (1-2 sentences)  Evidence: quotes or data used as support (1-2 sentences) Commentary: analyzes the evidence and connects it to the claim. (2-4 sentences)\n\n\n\nEvidence comes in all shapes and sizes. In English, teachers mainly require quotes from the text as evidence. In Social Studies, teachers may use artifacts (objects, maps, graphs). In science and math, data    is primarily used as evidence. A mix of all evidence may be presented in longer research projects.\nIn humanities, evidence is measured on how close it is to the original source. An original source is also known as a primary source. If someone paraphrases a primary source, it becomes a secondary source. If someone paraphrases a secondary source, it becomes a tertiary source. And so on...\nFor example: \n\n    \n        I conduct an experiment on water quality and publish my results: PRIMARY SOURCE\n        My friend writes about my results in the school newspaper: SECONDARY SOURCE\n        A national newspaper writes about my friend's article: TERTIARY SOURCE\n    \n\nA mix of all types of sources are needed in most research projects, depending on the topic, audience, and purpose.Watch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\nReading:Types of Evidence Used to Write a Paper\nPrevious activityQuiz 3.2\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 3.3\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
