		"text": "1.4 Characterization and Setting\n\n        Completion requirements\n        \n\n\n\nCharacterization\n\nIn short stories, most protagonists and antagonists are foils, or reflections of each other.  A foil is a \"leaf\" of bright metal (like tin foil) placed under a jewel to increase its brilliance.  Traditionally, a foil is a minor character who, through comparison and contrast, serves to highlight the brilliance of the protagonist. Foils are not necessarily opposites.\nFor example, Rainsford and Zaroff from \"The Most Dangerous Game\" are foils.  More specifically, Zaroff is a foil for Rainsford.  Whereas Rainsford is a traditional hunter of animals, Zaroff is the extreme version of the hunter: a murderous recluse bored of hunting animal prey.  Whereas Rainsford cares not for the feelings of his animal prey, Zaroff cares not for the feeling of his human prey. \nMontressor and Fortunado from \"The Cask of Amontillado\" are foils in a similar way.  Just as Zaroff hunts Rainsford, so too Montressor \"hunts\" Fortunado, luring him into his catacombs, but with a smile.  Whereas Rainsford and Zaroff are foreigners and strangers, Montressor and Fortunado are local acquaintances, wine connoisseurs, and festival-goers.  This mirror-image effect illuminates the brilliance of each set of characters: Rainsford's superior hunting abilities and Montressor's devious plan of revenge are both accentuated by contrasts.\nSettingThe settings of each short story play as significant a role as its characters.  In fact, each story's setting is like a character.  In terms of place, Shiptrap Island and the Montressor catacombs are living graveyards,\nhaunted by their twisted, murderous owners.  Time plays a more crucial role in \"The Cask of Amontillado,\" however. Since Montressor tells his story in flashback nearly fifty years after it happened, we must imagine him as a smug, vengeful old man.  If we believe his tale, the reader must assume that Montressor must be near death himself; otherwise, why would he finally confess his murder? Together, time and place give setting a context that must be considered first in\nany literary discussion. When and where a story takes place reveals the history of the narrative and provides key artifacts (symbols) about the motives of both narrator and storyteller.  \n\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:Setting in Literature\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 1.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 1.4\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

			"content": "Completion requirements\nCharacterization\n\nIn short stories, most protagonists and antagonists are foils, or reflections of each other.  A foil is a \"leaf\" of bright metal (like tin foil) placed under a jewel to increase its brilliance.  Traditionally, a foil is a minor character who, through comparison and contrast, serves to highlight the brilliance of the protagonist. Foils are not necessarily opposites.\nFor example, Rainsford and Zaroff from \"The Most Dangerous Game\" are foils.  More specifically, Zaroff is a foil for Rainsford.  Whereas Rainsford is a traditional hunter of animals, Zaroff is the extreme version of the hunter: a murderous recluse bored of hunting animal prey.  Whereas Rainsford cares not for the feelings of his animal prey, Zaroff cares not for the feeling of his human prey. \nMontressor and Fortunado from \"The Cask of Amontillado\" are foils in a similar way.  Just as Zaroff hunts Rainsford, so too Montressor \"hunts\" Fortunado, luring him into his catacombs, but with a smile.  Whereas Rainsford and Zaroff are foreigners and strangers, Montressor and Fortunado are local acquaintances, wine connoisseurs, and festival-goers.  This mirror-image effect illuminates the brilliance of each set of characters: Rainsford's superior hunting abilities and Montressor's devious plan of revenge are both accentuated by contrasts.\nSettingThe settings of each short story play as significant a role as its characters.  In fact, each story's setting is like a character.  In terms of place, Shiptrap Island and the Montressor catacombs are living graveyards,\nhaunted by their twisted, murderous owners.  Time plays a more crucial role in \"The Cask of Amontillado,\" however. Since Montressor tells his story in flashback nearly fifty years after it happened, we must imagine him as a smug, vengeful old man.  If we believe his tale, the reader must assume that Montressor must be near death himself; otherwise, why would he finally confess his murder? Together, time and place give setting a context that must be considered first in\nany literary discussion. When and where a story takes place reveals the history of the narrative and provides key artifacts (symbols) about the motives of both narrator and storyteller.  \n\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:Setting in Literature\nPrevious activityQuiz 1.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 1.4\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    2.4 Identity: Who am I?\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
