		"text": "1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n\n        Completion requirements\n        \n\n\n\nThe Cinderella Myth Retold\n\n\"Everyday Use\" is a modern version of the classic Cinderella fairy tale.  Walker tells us of two sisters, one of whom is like Cinderella, a humble domestic servant; the other is an entitled wayward sister.  Instead of fighting\n    over a glass slipper, the object of desire is a set of quilts, handmade family heirlooms dating back to the Civil War.  Instead of a prince seeking a future wife, the family matriarch, Mama (Mrs.\n    Johnson), is seeking to christen one of her daughters as her successor and the next leader of the family.  \n\nMaggie, the younger sister, is like Cinderella in terms of status, not looks.  She is homely, physically slow, none too bright, and physically scarred from the house fire.  Her mother, Mrs. Johnson, knows that she will have\n    a hard time marrying, but she knows just who it will be.  Maggie feels undeserving of her mother's attention and heirlooms (the quilts and butter churn).  Next to her sister, she cowers like an ugly duckling. \n\nDee, the older sister, is like one of Cinderella's stepsisters.  She is all that Maggie is not: mobile, attractive, educated, confident.  She mistreats her sister by making her feel inferior and worthless.  She feels her birthright\n    gives her a sense of entitlement to the quilts and butter churn, but instead of using them for their everyday intended uses, she wants to transform them into artifacts of the past, using her heritage as \"cultural\n    capital.\"  By changing her name to \"Wangero,\" wearing \"borrowed robes,\" and embracing the fad movement of black nationalism, her mother and sister barely recognized her.\n\n\"Everyday Use\" takes place in 1973 and the height of the Black Nationalist movement in which several African-Americans like Dee Johnson were changing their \"slave names\" (given to them by white masters) to Muslim ones.  Lew Alcindor became Karim Abdul-Jabar, following the likes of Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) and Malcolm Little (first Malcolm X, and then El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz).\nWho will be the next matriarch?  Will Mrs. Johnson give the quilts to Dee or Maggie?  Will the heirlooms be given their \"everyday use\" or become museum pieces?\n\nAssignment:  Read \"Everyday Use\" by Alice Walker.\n\nWatch the following videos to help you understand the story: \n\n\n\n\nReading:\nSymbols in \"Everyday Use\"\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 1.4\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 1.5\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell -

			"content": "Completion requirements\nThe Cinderella Myth Retold\n\n\"Everyday Use\" is a modern version of the classic Cinderella fairy tale.  Walker tells us of two sisters, one of whom is like Cinderella, a humble domestic servant; the other is an entitled wayward sister.  Instead of fighting\n    over a glass slipper, the object of desire is a set of quilts, handmade family heirlooms dating back to the Civil War.  Instead of a prince seeking a future wife, the family matriarch, Mama (Mrs.\n    Johnson), is seeking to christen one of her daughters as her successor and the next leader of the family.  \n\nMaggie, the younger sister, is like Cinderella in terms of status, not looks.  She is homely, physically slow, none too bright, and physically scarred from the house fire.  Her mother, Mrs. Johnson, knows that she will have\n    a hard time marrying, but she knows just who it will be.  Maggie feels undeserving of her mother's attention and heirlooms (the quilts and butter churn).  Next to her sister, she cowers like an ugly duckling. \n\nDee, the older sister, is like one of Cinderella's stepsisters.  She is all that Maggie is not: mobile, attractive, educated, confident.  She mistreats her sister by making her feel inferior and worthless.  She feels her birthright\n    gives her a sense of entitlement to the quilts and butter churn, but instead of using them for their everyday intended uses, she wants to transform them into artifacts of the past, using her heritage as \"cultural\n    capital.\"  By changing her name to \"Wangero,\" wearing \"borrowed robes,\" and embracing the fad movement of black nationalism, her mother and sister barely recognized her.\n\n\"Everyday Use\" takes place in 1973 and the height of the Black Nationalist movement in which several African-Americans like Dee Johnson were changing their \"slave names\" (given to them by white masters) to Muslim ones.  Lew Alcindor became Karim Abdul-Jabar, following the likes of Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) and Malcolm Little (first Malcolm X, and then El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz).\nWho will be the next matriarch?  Will Mrs. Johnson give the quilts to Dee or Maggie?  Will the heirlooms be given their \"everyday use\" or become museum pieces?\n\nAssignment:  Read \"Everyday Use\" by Alice Walker.\n\nWatch the following videos to help you understand the story: \n\n\n\n\nReading:\nSymbols in \"Everyday Use\"\nPrevious activityQuiz 1.4\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 1.5\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell -
