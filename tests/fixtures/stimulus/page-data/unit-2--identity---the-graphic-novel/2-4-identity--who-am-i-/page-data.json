they are vengeful and spiteful; they are part of the \"me\" culture.\nArchetypal characters, like the old Odysseus, who are humble are called \"eirons.\"  These are characters who are better than they think they are.  They are self-deprecating, who serve others, not themselves.\nEirons in literature include: Christ, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Batman, Simba, and Cinderella.  Eirons know they have growth potential; they need allies for support; they are charitable and loving; they are part of the \"we\" culture.\nLet's learn more about how we construct ourselves and our identities, how we tell our own stories.\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nThe Themes of Identity and Prejudice in American Born Chinese\n    \n        \n            \n                Previous activityQuiz 2.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 2.4\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Jump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">",

they are vengeful and spiteful; they are part of the \"me\" culture.\nArchetypal characters, like the old Odysseus, who are humble are called \"eirons.\"  These are characters who are better than they think they are.  They are self-deprecating, who serve others, not themselves.\nEirons in literature include: Christ, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Batman, Simba, and Cinderella.  Eirons know they have growth potential; they need allies for support; they are charitable and loving; they are part of the \"we\" culture.\nLet's learn more about how we construct ourselves and our identities, how we tell our own stories.\nWatch the following videos to learn more:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\nThe Themes of Identity and Prejudice in American Born Chinese\nPrevious activityQuiz 2.3\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Next activityQuiz 2.4\nJump to...\n            \n        \n                    Jump to...\n                    Course Instructions\n                    How This Course Works  & Suggested Timeline\n                    Submitting Your Assignments\n                    Ask The Teacher\n                    MANDATORY QUIZ\n                    Learning Objectives & Standards Met By This Course\n                    Unit 1 Study Guide\n                    1.1 Plot Structure\n                    Quiz 1.1\n                    1.2 Richard Connell - \"The Most Dangerous Game\"\n                    Quiz 1.2\n                    1.3 Edgar Allan Poe - \"The Cask of Amontillado\"\n                    Quiz 1.3\n                    1.4 Characterization and Setting\n                    Quiz 1.4\n                    1.5 Alice Walker - \"Everyday Use\"\n                    Quiz 1.5\n                    1.6 Theme and Point of View\n                    Quiz 1.6\n                    Unit 1 Assignment: Literary Analysis\n                    Unit 1 Test\n                    Unit 2 Study Guide\n                    2.1 American Born Chinese\n                    Quiz 2.1\n                    2.2 \"Show and Tell\" - Graphic Essay\n                    Quiz 2.2\n                    2.3 Archetypes in Literature\n                    Quiz 2.3\n                    Quiz 2.4\n                    2.5 Culture: Who are we?\n                    Quiz 2.5\n                    2.6 Literacy Narrative: How does language define us?\n                    Quiz 2.6\n                    Unit 2 Assignment: Graphic Literacy Narrative\n                    Unit 2 Test\n                    Unit 3 Study Guide\n                    3.1 Writing Claims\n                    Quiz 3.1\n                    3.2 Logical Reasoning\n                    Quiz 3.2\n                    3.3 Choosing Types of Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.3\n                    3.4 Commentary: Analyzing Evidence\n                    Quiz 3.4\n                    3.5 Synthesizing Information\n                    Quiz 3.5\n                    3.6 Rebuttals and Counterarguments\n                    Quiz 3.6\n                    Unit 3 Assignment: Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 3 Test\n                    Unit 4 Study Guide\n                    4.1 Types of Verse and Sound Devices\n                    Quiz 4.1\n                    4.2 Poet vs. Speaker\n                    Quiz 4.2\n                    4.3 Types of Imagery\n                    Quiz 4.3\n                    4.4 The Sonnet\n                    Quiz 4.4\n                    Unit 4 Assignment: Analyzing a Sonnet\n                    Unit 4 Test\n                    Unit 5 Study Guide\n                    5.1 Who's Who in Verona: Romeo and Juliet\n                    Quiz 5.1\n                    5.2 The Role of Language in Shakespeare\n                    Quiz 5.2\n                    5.3 Figurative Language\n                    Quiz 5.3\n                    5.4 Dualities, Juxaposition, and Foils\n                    Quiz 5.4\n                    5.5 Types of Irony\n                    Quiz 5.5\n                    Unit 5 Assignment: Tracking Chart and Synthesis Writing\n                    Unit 5 Test\n                    Reattempt up to 2 Unit Tests\n                    Practice Final\n                    Course Feedback\n                    Request a Transcript\n        \n            \n                <input type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary ms-1\" value=\"Go\">"
