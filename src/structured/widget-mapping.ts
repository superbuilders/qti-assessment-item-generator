**⚠️ CRITICAL: GRAMMATICAL ERROR CORRECTION ⚠️**
WE MUST correct any grammatical errors found in the source Perseus content. This includes:
- Spelling mistakes in words and proper nouns
- Incorrect punctuation, capitalization, and sentence structure
- Subject-verb disagreement and other grammatical issues
- Awkward phrasing that impacts clarity
- Missing or incorrect articles (a, an, the)

The goal is to produce clean, professional educational content that maintains the original meaning while fixing any language errors present in the source material.

**CRITICAL RULE: WIDGET_NOT_FOUND BAIL**
This is your most important instruction. If you determine that a widget slot **CANNOT** be reasonably mapped to any of the available widget types, you **MUST** use the exact string literal **"WIDGET_NOT_FOUND"** as its type. Do not guess or force a fit.

Use "WIDGET_NOT_FOUND" if:
1.  There is no semantically appropriate widget type in the provided list for the given Perseus content.
2.  A slot clearly represents an interactive element that was misclassified as a widget.`

**WIDGET SELECTION RULES (urlImage is a STRICT last resort)**
- **CRITICAL HIERARCHY** for visual content:
  1. FIRST: Map to a semantically specific widget that matches the content
  2. SECOND: If no specific widget fits, and the content is a truly static, non-semantic visual, then use \`urlImage\`
  3. LAST: Only use \`WIDGET_NOT_FOUND\` if the content cannot be represented by any widget including \`urlImage\`
- **Aggressive preference**: Always choose a purpose-built widget over \`urlImage\` whenever a match exists in the available list.

- Prefer specific widgets over \`urlImage\`:
  - Graphs/charts/plots: choose graph/plot widgets (e.g., \`barChart\`, \`lineGraph\`, \`conceptualGraph\`, \`scatterPlot\`, \`populationBarChart\`, etc.)
  - Set comparisons: choose \`vennDiagram\`
  - Reference resources: choose specific resource widgets (e.g., \`periodicTable\`)
  - Emoji-only assets: choose \`emojiImage\`

- When \`urlImage\` MAY be acceptable (still last resort):
  - A plain photograph or illustration (e.g., a whale, a cat, a lab apparatus) where no more specific widget exists in this collection
  - Visual content that does not match any specific widget but can be displayed as a static image

**DO NOT USE urlImage for Graphie-generated graphs/charts**
- If the Perseus JSON indicates that an \`image\` is actually a graph/chart produced by Graphie, you MUST map to a graph widget and NOT to \`urlImage\`.
- Treat any \`image\` with a \`backgroundImage.url\` starting with \`web+graphie://\` (or containing \`ka-perseus-graphie\`) as a graph/chart with programmatic overlays.
- If the alt text or problem text clearly describes a graph/chart (e.g., "bar graph", "line graph", "scatter plot", axes, ticks), then map to a specific graph widget even if numbers/labels are not baked into the underlying bitmap.
- Rationale: Graphie overlays axes, ticks, and labels dynamically; we already have graph widgets that render these semantics natively and accessibly.

Example — Graphie bar graph (DO NOT map to urlImage):
\`\`\`json
{
  "widgets": {
    "image 1": {
      "type": "image",
      "options": {
        "alt": "A bar graph is shown...",
        "backgroundImage": {
          "url": "web+graphie://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/65b7bb67f52aaaa9932dc39482e8f2e516840676",
          "width": 300,
          "height": 270
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`
Correct mapping when graph widgets are available:
\`\`\`json
{
  "widget_mapping": {
    "image 1": "barChart" // or another specific graph widget listed in this collection
  }
}
\`\`\`

- **IMPORTANT**: Only use \`urlImage\` for graphs if and only if the collection provides no graph-capable widgets at all. Prefer domain-specific graph widgets whenever available.`
	}

	systemInstruction += `

**CRITICAL RULE**: You MUST choose a widget type from the list (or "WIDGET_NOT_FOUND") for every slot. Do not refuse or omit any slot.

**STRICT NAMING-BASED MAPPING RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):**
- For science collection free-body-diagram conversions, any slot whose name starts with \`fbd_\` MUST be mapped to \`freeBodyDiagram\`.
  - Specifically: \`fbd_choice_a\`, \`fbd_choice_b\`, \`fbd_choice_c\` → \`freeBodyDiagram\`.
  - NEVER return \`WIDGET_NOT_FOUND\` for these slots.
- Choice-level visual widgets declared for multiple choice interactions (e.g., names ending with \`_choice_a\`, \`_choice_b\`, \`_choice_c\`) MUST be mapped to a concrete widget type, not \`WIDGET_NOT_FOUND\`. Inspect the scenario and choose the correct type from the allowed list.

`

	const userContent = `Based on the Perseus JSON and assessment body below, create a JSON object that maps each widget slot name to the most appropriate widget type.

Perseus JSON:
\`\`\`json
${perseusJson}
\`\`\`

Assessment Item Body (as structured JSON):
\`\`\`json
${assessmentBody}
\`\`\`

${createWidgetSelectionPromptSection(widgetCollection)}

 MANDATORY RULES FOR CHOICE-LEVEL VISUALS:
 - You will be given a list of slot names. Map **only** the \`widgetId\`s explicitly provided. Never invent, derive, or normalize slot names based on observed patterns. Focus on the semantic content of each widget to determine its type.
 - Choice-level widget slots are reserved for visuals that appear INSIDE interaction choices (e.g., images/diagrams in radio choices).
 - CRITICAL: If a choice contains ONLY a mathematical equation or expression with no diagram, that choice should NOT have a widget slot. Do NOT map equation-only choices to any widget type. The correct representation is inline MathML in the choice content.
 - Do NOT assume these widgets appear in the top-level body; they are intentionally absent from the body and will be inserted inside choices later.

Your response must be a JSON object with a single key "widget_mapping", mapping every slot name from the list below to its type. If no suitable type is found, you MUST use the string "WIDGET_NOT_FOUND". However, for FBD slots (names starting with \`fbd_\`), you MUST map to \`freeBodyDiagram\` and MUST NOT use \`WIDGET_NOT_FOUND\`.

Slot Names to Map:
${slotNames.join("\n")}`

	const WidgetMappingSchema = createWidgetMappingSchema(slotNames, widgetCollection.widgetTypeKeys)
	// Resource mapping guidance (collection-aware): When Perseus includes reference resources
	// such as periodic tables and the collection supports a corresponding widget type
	// (e.g., 'periodicTable'), prefer mapping the slot to that type instead of bailing.
