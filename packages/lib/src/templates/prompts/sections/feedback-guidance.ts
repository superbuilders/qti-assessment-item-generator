<feedback>
- Compute every feedback message from derived values (e.g., numeric differences, correct option text).
- Provide at least one corrective hint that references the learner's mistake and demonstrates the correct computation.
- Provide an overall success message that cites the computed answer.
- Structure feedback using helper functions or small utilities to avoid duplication.
